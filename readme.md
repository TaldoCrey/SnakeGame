# Snake Game

This repository is a studying repository that I made to start my studyings with the SFML graphical library of C++ language.

I made a basic Snake Game for Linux and Windows.

# Usage

## Windows
Install the windows release, and have fun! (If there are any errors, please open a Issue).

## Linux
First, install the SFML-2.6 in your linux distribuition. (It should be the default version of your package manager).

Finally, after installing the SFML library, just download the Linux version and have fun! (If there are any erros, please open a Issue).
